Dalamud plugin that adds immersive flavor text to the game, along with a popup window to let you know when it is raining and easily allow you to take out your umbrella.
At first, it was supposed to be a RP Toolkit, it's purpose is mostly to help me learn how to make dalamud plugins, as such it's quite simple in it's functionality. I do intend to add more, but currently it only detects when it begins raining and prompts you to take out your umbrella, as I always wish I notice it raining more frequently and always forget. The other thing it does so far is provide flavor text based on temperature and weather conditions.

To install, simply add:

to your list of custom repositories.
