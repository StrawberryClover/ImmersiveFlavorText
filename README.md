Dalamud plugin that adds immersive flavor text to the game, mostly in the form of trying to emulate further climate conditions such as temperature, for now. It also can automatically change your glamour via integration with Glamourer that will activate under temperature and weather conditions per outfit.

At first, it was supposed to be a RP Toolkit, it's purpose is mostly to help me learn how to make dalamud plugins, as such it's quite simple in it's functionality. I do intend to add more, but the main thing it does so far is provide flavor text based on temperature and weather conditions. I added the ability to automatically change glamour based on temperature as a personal feature of mine that I wish for.


To install, simply add:

to your list of custom repositories.
